        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mileage Fraud and Counterfeit Parts – A Silent Epidemic</h2>
    
        <h3>Mileage Fraud: The Hidden Deception</h3>
        <p>
            Each year, millions of used vehicles are sold globally with falsified mileage, creating a widespread issue 
            that affects the economy, driver safety, and the environment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Universal Problem:</strong> In Europe, <strong>15.2% of used cars</strong> have altered mileage, according to <strong>carVertical (2023)</strong>. In Germany, this figure reaches nearly <strong>20%</strong>, causing average losses of <strong>€4,000 to €6,000</strong> per vehicle. In the United States, <strong>450,000 cars</strong> are sold annually with manipulated odometers, resulting in a total loss of <strong>$1 billion</strong> for buyers. 
                (<a href="https://www.carvertical.com/" target="_blank">carVertical, 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.carfax.com/" target="_blank">Carfax, 2024</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Colossal Financial Impact:</strong> In Europe alone, mileage fraud costs consumers nearly <strong>€9.6 billion annually</strong>. Beyond the purchase price, unsuspecting buyers face unexpected repair costs and breakdowns. 
                (<a href="https://www.quechoisir.org/" target="_blank">UFC-Que Choisir, 2023</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Safety Risks:</strong> Driving a vehicle with falsified mileage significantly increases risks. Worn brakes, aging suspensions, or engines nearing failure pose a direct threat to road safety.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>A $45 Billion Black Market:</strong> Approximately <strong>15% of all automotive parts globally</strong> are counterfeit, according to the <strong>World Customs Organization (2023)</strong>. These parts mimic originals but often fail basic safety tests. 
                (<a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/" target="_blank">WCO, 2023</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shocking Statistics:</strong> An <strong>AAA (2023)</strong> study revealed that <strong>85% of counterfeit brake pads</strong> fail to meet minimum safety standards. In some cases, these parts double braking distances, significantly increasing the risk of accidents. 
                (<a href="https://www.aaa.com/" target="_blank">AAA, 2023</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Massive Seizures:</strong> In 2022, Mercedes-Benz conducted <strong>500 raids across 60 countries</strong>, confiscating <strong>1.7 million counterfeit parts</strong>. Despite these efforts, the problem continues to grow. 
                (<a href="https://www.daimler.com/" target="_blank">Daimler AG, 2023</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Real Consequences for Everyone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Consumers:</strong> Buying a car with falsified mileage or counterfeit parts can cost thousands in repairs and compromise passenger safety.</li>
            <li><strong>For the Industry:</strong> Counterfeiting robs legitimate manufacturers of billions annually, stifling innovation and driving up costs for genuine products.</li>
            <li><strong>For Society:</strong> In South Africa, <strong>20% of serious accidents</strong> are linked to counterfeit parts. Similar issues are underreported in other regions. 
                (<a href="https://www.naamsa.co.za/" target="_blank">NAAMSA, 2023</a>)

    <div id="point2" style="padding: 20px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Point 2: Vehicle Traceability – Revolutionizing Transparency in the Automotive Industry</h2>
    
        <h3>The lack of transparency: A systemic issue</h3>
        <p>
            The automotive industry has long suffered from a lack of effective vehicle traceability. Buyers, insurers, and even governments often struggle to access reliable data about a vehicle's history, creating a climate of distrust and fueling fraudulent activities.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Incomplete or falsified histories:</strong> Existing databases, often fragmented by country or manufacturer, leave significant gaps in information. Approximately <strong>25% of used vehicles sold globally</strong> show discrepancies in their history, according to a 2023 McKinsey study.
                (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/" target="_blank">McKinsey & Co., 2023</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Significant economic losses:</strong> The lack of traceability costs the global automotive industry around <strong>$60 billion annually</strong>, through fraud or additional expenses to reconstruct reliable histories.
                (<a href="https://www.allianz.com/" target="_blank">Allianz Partners, 2024</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>A barrier to a circular economy:</strong> Traceability is essential to promote the reuse of parts and recycling of vehicles, a priority aligned with global climate objectives.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Current technology: An imperfect solution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of international standardization:</strong> Each country or manufacturer uses its own systems, making a unified overview impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Data that isn’t immutable:</strong> Existing databases can be altered or hacked, undermining their reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>High costs:</strong> Services like Carfax charge significant fees for reports that are often incomplete.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Carify: Ushering in a new era of automotive traceability</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>A unique NFT for every vehicle:</strong> Each car is associated with a unique NFT containing all critical data: mileage, repair history, accidents, and ownership records. This NFT serves as a trustworthy "digital identity card," accessible anytime.</li>
            <li><strong>A global, immutable ledger:</strong> Unlike traditional databases, blockchain-stored information is tamper-proof. Every update is timestamped and verified by the network, eliminating fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal accessibility:</strong> Buyers, dealers, and insurers can access a vehicle’s full history by scanning a QR code or using a dedicated app.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>A positive impact for all stakeholders</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For buyers:</strong> You can purchase a vehicle with confidence, knowing its data is complete and reliable.</li>
            <li><strong>For dealers and manufacturers:</strong> Better traceability enhances consumer trust and reduces disputes. It also opens up opportunities for premium services like certified used vehicle programs.</li>
            <li><strong>For governments:</strong> Enhanced transparency curtails tax fraud and simplifies the enforcement of environmental regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>For the environment:</strong> Effective traceability encourages part reuse and recycling, fostering a more sustainable industry.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Economic and societal impact</h3>
        <p>
            According to a 2024 Deloitte analysis, a solution like Carify’s could:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce fraud by 80%,</strong> saving billions annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Boost dealer revenues</strong> through blockchain-based certification programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower CO₂ emissions</strong> tied to new part production by increasing recycling.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Conclusion: Transparency as a fundamental pillar</h3>
        <p>
            At Carify, we believe trust is essential in every automotive transaction. By leveraging blockchain for traceability, we provide consumers, professionals, and governments with a powerful tool to create a safer, fairer, and more sustainable marketplace.

        <h3>A sector in crisis: Current challenges in automotive insurance</h3>
        <p>
            The automotive insurance market, while essential, is often criticized for its inefficiencies and lack of transparency. Both consumers and insurers face numerous obstacles that undermine trust and drive up costs.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Widespread fraud:</strong> In Europe, insurance fraud costs an estimated <strong>€13 billion annually</strong> in the automotive sector. In the United States, fraud totals approximately <strong>$30 billion each year</strong>, with these losses ultimately passed on to consumers through higher premiums.
                (<a href="https://www.insuranceeurope.eu/" target="_blank">Insurance Europe, 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">FBI, 2024</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lack of reliable data:</strong> According to a McKinsey study (2023), <strong>40% of insurance claims</strong> are undervalued or contain errors. Incomplete or falsified vehicle histories make accurate risk assessments challenging.
                (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/" target="_blank">McKinsey & Co., 2023</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inefficient processes:</strong> Automotive insurance claims take an average of <strong>30–45 days</strong> to process, causing frustration for insured parties. The administrative complexity contributes to high operational costs for insurers and dissatisfaction for clients.
                (<a href="https://www.pwc.com/" target="_blank">PwC, 2023</a>)
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>How Carify addresses these issues with blockchain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Transparent vehicle history for insurers:</strong> Each vehicle registered in the Carify ecosystem comes with an NFT that provides an immutable, detailed history, including:

            </li>
            <li><strong>Fair premiums through enhanced transparency:</strong> Current systems unfairly penalize cautious drivers, as premiums often subsidize the costs of high-risk individuals. With Carify:
                <ul>
                    <li>Insurers can base premiums on accurate, tamper-proof data.</li>

                </ul>
                ➡️ <strong>Direct impact:</strong> A fairer system that restores consumer trust and incentivizes responsible behavior.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>A win-win partnership for insurers and consumers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For insurers:</strong>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Point 4: Physical and Digital License Plates – A Revolution in Traceability and Security</h2>
    
        <h3>A timeless issue: Vehicle traceability</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional license plates, while essential, provide limited information about a vehicle's true identity. They fail to capture its complete history or precise legal status, leaving room for fraudulent activities such as duplication, identity theft, and counterfeit plates.

                <p>
                    Through NFT-backed authentication, consumers and garages can verify the origin and legitimacy of replacement parts installed in their vehicles.

        <h3>A global challenge: Inefficiency and opacity in the insurance industry</h3>
        <p>
            The automotive insurance industry is indispensable, yet it faces critical challenges that undermine trust and efficiency. These problems impact both consumers and insurers, driving up costs and creating frustration.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rampant fraud:</strong>
                <p>
                    Insurance fraud costs the global industry <strong>over $80 billion annually</strong>, with a significant portion stemming from inflated or falsified claims in the automotive sector.
                </p>
                <p>(<a href="https://www.iaisweb.org/" target="_blank">IAIS, 2023</a>)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lack of transparency:</strong>
                <p>
                    Consumers often struggle to understand how premiums are calculated. The opaque and inconsistent data behind pricing leaves room for confusion and dissatisfaction.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Slow claims processing:</strong>
                <p>
                    The average claim takes <strong>30 to 45 days</strong> to process, causing frustration for policyholders. Administrative inefficiencies add to the costs and delay payouts.

        <h3>The challenge: Driving an automotive ecological revolution</h3>
        <p>
            The automotive industry is at a turning point. With nearly <strong>20% of global CO2 emissions</strong> coming from transportation, the urgency for sustainable solutions is undeniable. Yet, the lack of transparency, incentives for recycling, and integration with smart infrastructure continues to hinder progress.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A global issue:</strong> The lifecycle of a vehicle generates over <strong>30% of its total emissions</strong> before it even hits the road. (<a href="https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank">IEA, 2024</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Recycling shortfalls:</strong> Only <strong>25% of automotive materials</strong> are effectively reused or recycled. (<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European Environment Agency, 2023</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Lagging smart integration:</strong> Fewer than <strong>10% of vehicles worldwide</strong> are connected to existing smart infrastructure, limiting efficiency and innovation.</li>
